## This app is a music app that takes a Traditional irish tune and pulls back from The Session.org's API the tune corresponding to the name entered by the user.  

## The dots of the music are printed to the screen as well as the abc notation along with the key, the type, which is if it is a jig or a reel, the meter, the term L, which has to do with the length of time each note represents, which in this app is set to 1/8.  The following is how the app is represented by abcnotation:
  ### X: id
  ### T: name
  ### L:
  ### M: mode
  ### T: type
  ### K: key
  ### abc

  ## The user has the option of choosing a 2nd and/ or 3rd tune based upon a key choice and a list of tunes will appear with another API call to The Session.org for the tunes.  The user will choose a tune and the tune is added to their Tunebook.
  ## After user is done with putting sets together based on each key choices, their Tunebook shows up with the a tagged tunes they have chosen.  They now have CRUD ability with their Tunebook.
